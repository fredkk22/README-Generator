## Description

This Module 9 Challenge was create an automatic professional README generator through a command line operator so as to save time for any software engineer who is attempting to create a licensed application but does not have enough time to lay out a full README file.

The reason for creating this challenge was to learn more about Node.js, the inquirer package, and command line applications.

I was able to learn everything I listed above and believe that if given more time or if I were to develop my own idea, I could develop a full command line application using Node.js on my own. My confidence in using Node.js has skyrocketed through this project, and I very much enjoyed working on it.

## Video Recording

Due to the fact that the README Generator is not a deployed application, I recorded the README Generator in action.
